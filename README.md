# Django Playground
Welcome to my Django project, where I explore Django's features and continuously enhance my skills.

### Scalability
The application is entirely scalable, with a project structure divided into modules, and content generated from the database. Improving this application is easier than one might imagine.

### Authentication
Each user has their profile, separate statistics, and their own buildings. Make any changes, and they will be updated instantly.

### Live Data and Stats
A significant portion of the data, besides the standard Django method of transmission, also uses JavaScript, making it dynamically displayed.
